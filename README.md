This is for the Xorigin aipi as seen below. 

128x128 full RGB screen with white led.
3 buttons on the board. 2 external that you can click on and one internal for GPIO0(dont need to flash.
Single speaker
single MIC
Device has magnets so you potentially be put on a fridge is you like.
RGB Led that can be tiggered during listening  or whatever you want.

The device has ability to have battery pack to have it wireless(don't know run times or if it works right yet)

Device is found on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQNNVV36?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1

Flashing is pretty straight forward. Get the file, put in your variables and plug in, no button pressing nothing just flash it and off to the races. The base yml is based off the S3 box but it's price point is $16.99 currently. I spent some time figuing out the pins(FML) and getting the LA to figure out what line did what and the start sequence of the screen.
